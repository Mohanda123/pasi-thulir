Pasithulir is a community-driven food donation platform designed to reduce food wastage and feed the hungry. In many parts of Chennai and other cities, people struggle without proper meals, while large amounts of food go to waste in hotels, restaurants, party halls, and functions.
Pasithulir acts as a bridge between donors (who have excess food) and receivers (NGOs, orphanages, homeless shelters, or needy individuals).
